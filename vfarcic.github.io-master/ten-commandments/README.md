# The Ten Commandments Of Continuous Delivery

## Synopsis

Why did your attempt to implement continuous delivery fail? There cannot be one answer that fits all scenarios. However, some prerequisites and steps should be taken in almost all cases. The chances are that you missed some, if not all, of the commandments that we’ll explore in this session.

## Abstract

Everyone wants to implement continuous delivery. After all, the benefits are too big to be ignored. You can:

* Increase the speed of delivery
* Increase software quality
* Decrease costs
* Free people to dedicate time to activities that generate real value

Those improvements are like music to any decision maker’s ear. Especially if that person has a business background. If a tech geek can articulate the benefits continuous delivery brings to the table, when he asks a business representative for a budget, the response is almost always “Yes! Do it.”

Then a continuous delivery project will start. Tests will be written. Builds will be scripted. Deployments will be automated. Everything will be tied into an automated pipeline and triggered on every commit. Everyone will enter a state of nirvana as soon as all that is done. There will be a huge inauguration party with a vice president having the honor to be the first one to press the button that will deploy the first release to production. Isn’t that a glorious plan everyone should be proud of?

The project starts and, shortly afterward, you hit the first obstacle. But, since you are brave and do not give up that easily, you pass it. Then, not long afterward, another obstacle comes along. And another one after that. And on and on it goes. Half a year later you feel that you are not getting far. You spent your budget. You need to show results even though you cannot see the light at the end of the tunnel. The CTO demands results. The business wants value for the investment. You decide to do the only sensible thing and declare that the project is finished. You are continuous delivery certified even though there is nothing continuous nor are you delivering. Continuous delivery joins other failed projects that are declared a big success. Not only that, you are doing agile but you also practice CD. Veni, vidi, vici. You joined the club of glorified failures. Well done!

Why did your attempt to implement continuous delivery fail? There cannot be one answer that fits all scenarios. However, some prerequisites and steps should be taken in almost all cases. The chances are that you missed some, if not all, of the commandments that we’ll explore in this session.
