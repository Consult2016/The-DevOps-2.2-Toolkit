The DevOps 2.0 Toolkit
======================

Abstract: Talk
--------------

Agile changed the way we develop software, but it failed to change the way we deliver it. As a result of facing new challenges, we got DevOps. We got a cross-disciplinary community of practice dedicated to the study of building, evolving and operating rapidly changing resilient systems at scale.

DevOps is as much a cultural as technological change. While it united diverse teams and professionals and thought us how to automate all repetitive steps in our processes, it failed to introduce a real difference in the software landscape we use. Hence, DevOps 2.0 emerged with a drastic change in our methods, tools, and architecture. Finally, we have everything we need to build scalable, fault-tolerant, and self-healing systems delivered to production through continuous deployment.

This talk focuses on architectural changes and new tools we should adopt to be able to tackle the problems presented by a demand for modern, responsive, fault tolerant, and elastic systems. It is based on the material published in [The DevOps 2.0 Toolkit: Automating the Continuous Deployment Pipeline with Containerized Microservices](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BJ4V66M) book.

Abstract: Workshop
------------------

Agile changed the way we develop software, but it failed to change the way we deliver it. As a result of facing new challenges, we got **DevOps**. We got a cross-disciplinary community of practice dedicated to the study of building, evolving and operating rapidly changing resilient systems at scale.

DevOps is as much a cultural as technological change. While it united diverse teams and professionals and thought us how to automate all repetitive steps in our processes, it failed to introduce a real difference in the software landscape we use. Hence, DevOps 2.0 emerged with a drastic change in our methods, tools, and architecture. Finally, we have everything we need to build scalable, fault-tolerant, and self-healing systems delivered to production through continuous deployment.

This workshop focuses on architectural changes and new tools we should adopt to be able to tackle the problems presented by a demand for modern, responsive, fault tolerant, and elastic systems. It is based on the material published in **[The DevOps 2.0 Toolkit: Automating the Continuous Deployment Pipeline with Containerized Microservices](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BJ4V66M)** book.

The workshop will go through the whole **microservices development lifecycle**. We'll start from the very beginning. We'll define and design architecture. From there on we'll move from requirements, technological choices and development environment setup, through coding and testing all the way until the final deployment to production. We won't stop there. Once our new services are up and running we'll see how to maintain them, scale them depending on resource utilization and response time, recover them in case of failures and create central monitoring and notifications system. We'll try to balance the need for creative manual work and the need to automate as much of the process as possible.

This will be a journey through all the aspects of the lives of microservices and everything that surrounds them. We'll see how microservices fit into continuous deployment and immutable containers concepts and why the best results are obtained when those three are combined into one unique framework.

During the workshop we'll explore tools like **Docker, Docker Swarm, Docker Compose, Ansible, Consul, etcd, confd, Registrator, nginx, HAProxy, ElasticSearch, LogStash, Kibana**, and so on.

Learning Outcomes
=================

* DevOps: A cross-disciplinary community of practice dedicated to the study of building, evolving and operating rapidly-changing resilient systems at scale.
* The DevOps Toolkit

  * Configuration management and provisioning
  * Immutable deployments
  * Service discovery
  * Dynamic proxies
  * Zero-downtime continuous deployment
  * Cluster management
  * Self-healing
  * Centralized monitoring and logging
  * ... and much more

* The objective: everything after a commit fully automated without human intervention
* Configuration management: repeatable, automated, and fast provisioning; not for deploying applications
* Deployments: immutable, through containers (Docker) or VMs (in special cases)
* Cluster orchestration: cannot be manual, treat servers as cattle
* Service discovery: replaces traditional (static) configuration
* Proxy: needs to be dynamic
* Deployment downtime: blue-green or rolling upgrades
* Continuous delivery/deployment: decentralized and defined as code
* Logging: must be centralized
* Fault tolerance: requires self-healing
* Architecture: needs to change towards smaller services
* Culture: needs to follow technological changes (and vice versa)

### Pitch

The talk describes best practices we're facing when working on distributed systems at scale.

### Bio

**Viktor Farcic** is a Senior Consultant at **[CloudBees](https://www.cloudbees.com/)**, a member of the **[Docker Captains](https://www.docker.com/community/docker-captains)** group, and books author.

He coded using a plethora of languages starting with Pascal (yes, he is old), Basic (before it got Visual prefix), ASP (before it got .Net suffix), C, C++, Perl, Python, ASP.Net, Visual Basic, C#, JavaScript, Java, Scala, etc. He never worked with Fortran. His current favorite is **Go**.

His big passions are **Microservices**, **Continuous Integration**, **Delivery and Deployment (CI/CD)** and **Test-Driven Development**.

He often speaks at community gatherings and conferences.

He wrote [The DevOps 2.0 Toolkit: Automating the Continuous Deployment Pipeline with Containerized Microservices](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BJ4V66M) and [Test-Driven Java Development](http://www.amazon.com/Test-Driven-Java-Development-Viktor-Farcic-ebook/dp/B00YSIM3SC) books.
